# Books4Everyone

## The Big Idea
Books for Everyone is an app created by educators, parents, and community members to provide a hub where users can donate, receive, and obtain information on books that feature diverse characters.  This application arose from the shared belief that parents and children need greater access to inform about literature that highlights characters from different races, genders, and backgrounds.  We also found that many low-income households in Philadelphia, many of whom are people of color or live in households where English is not the primary language, need a way to obtain free books that feature diverse characters for their home libraries.  It is proven that students must continue to develop their literacy skills outside of school hours, and it is important that they read literature that is a true reflect of America’s culturally and racially diverse population.  The four founding members of this app – Charles Goodwin, Drita Dhami, Jonathan Dowd, and Sara Broad – worked together to create a user-friendly application that utilizes a multitude of technologies. In particular, we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, a Firebase database,  JQuery, and various APIs to meet our group goals.  We are excited about the potential that this application can have on the children in Philadelphia and hope to expand it to include more available technologies.
